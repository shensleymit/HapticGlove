To make sure that there are no errors importing files, download pyserial from the interwebs and save it in
the same Folder as all the other files (RunMe.py, etc.), .

Copy Leap.py from LeapMotion/LeapDeveloperKit/LeapSDK/lib into the Folder and copy all of the files from
the x64 or x86 folder (depending on your computer) to the same Folder.

Make sure all the COM ports in the Python files match up with the COM port to which the Arduino is connected.

Make sure the Arduino and LeapMotion are plugged into the computer. Upload FC2 to the Arduino. Run RunMe2.py.
